need to read in the file, four? bytes at a time, setting a var equal to each fixed length
segment. For that segment, eval the action based on the opcode, probably a large if else statement
for determining which function to actually do with the data

-- some will be simple, just add, sub, etc
-- others will take more time like the call instruction that does something with the stack...
-- need to simulate a virtual stack using an array I think -- as you add new items to the stack, 
you also increment the length, and you search starting from the end of the array
-- BUT you also need to implement deleting from the stack + shifting all the indices
